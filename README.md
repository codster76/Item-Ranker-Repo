# Item Ranker

Using Unity 2019.4.3.

A Unity app used to rank/prioritise a list of things.

It takes a text file containing all of the things to be ranked, then presents them to you in rounds for you to pick which items to prioritise.

It will eventually allow you to create a complete ordered list of the items, though, you can stop early and come out with a partially completed list.

Blue text is the order in which you trace.
